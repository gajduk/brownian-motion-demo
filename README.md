Brownian Motion demo
========================

This is a simulation of the Brownian motion of a big particle (dust particle) that collides with a large set of smaller particles (molecules of a gas) which move with different velocities in different random directions.


Also contains a custom implementation of an efficient PrioirityQueue that supports generics.


Made after instruction from the course on [Algorithms And Data Structures 1 from Princeton University.](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI).


Here are some images from the demo
